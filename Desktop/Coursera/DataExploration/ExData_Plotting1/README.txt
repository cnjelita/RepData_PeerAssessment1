For the first project in Exploratory Data Analysis, we need to reproduce the four plots in the figure folder.

To reproduce one of the plots, simply run each plot source code from the project directory. Modify the command for plots 2-4. The data is stored into power-data.rds for quick and convenient access.

The reproducted plots are stored in plots.
